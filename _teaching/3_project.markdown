What makes us human? How do we differ - and how are we the same - as our ancestral relatives? This course helps us explore these questions, and many more!

#### What makes us "human"?

Humans are a product of natural selection. But we also live in complex societies that have shaped our past and continue to shape our biology. If we want to understand "What makes us human?", we must use as many conceptual and methodological tools as possible. We have many opportunities to do this in the field of Human Biology!

Human biologists are interested in humans as *evolved, biological organisms living in a socially and technologically complex worlds*. This means that we include our evolutionary and historical pasts, and our individual and socially-constructed present. We are the product of who we were, but also who we are becoming.

Understanding this means we grapple with challenging topics, including race, gender, class, colonialism, and inequality. But we also explore the diversity of human beings around the world and what this can tell us about what makes us human

This may seem like a lot to take on...and it is! But it's important, and what we learn - from the literature and from each other - will shape us beyond this class and beyond ourselves! 


#### Topics covered will include:

* What does it mean to be "human"?
 - How are humans different from other species?
 - How are humans _similar to_ other species?
* Why do we study human diversity? 
* How do we study human diversity? 
 - Why is evolution important? 
 - Why is developmental context important? 
 - Why is social context important? 
* What are the benefits of Human Biology? 
* What are the limitations in humans from a Human Biological perspective? 
* What might it mean to be a "human" in the future? 
 - What role will the environment play in human diversity, selection, and health in the future? 
 - What role will technology play in human diversity, selection, and health in the future? 



#### What to expect

** This course requires a detailed understanding of basic biology and an engagement with the material. That means students will need to memorize new ideas in biology, physiology, genetics, and evolutionary theory **. However, students are also asked to think critically about the materials, and challenge themselves and the material in their response papers and exams.


**Required readings:** 
 * Stinson, S. SC, Bogin. B. and O'Rourke, D.H. Human Biology: An evolutionary and biocultural perspective. Wiley-Blackwell; 2007.

**Articles:**
 * Articles will be posted on Canvas the week before readings are to be done.
 
More information about class structure and readings will be posted to Canvas and provided in the syllabus.
