I am a **virtual science mentor** for high-school students across Chicagoland and Illinois. 

I help students develop their scientific thinking and communication skills. I believe that skills like prediction, logic, induction, and recognizing the strengths and weakness of evidence are innate **life skills* that can be cultivated to produce happier and more productive members of society.

I also believe that all students come with strengths that can be capitalized on for growth and development. Often the key is finding what drives them forward, and capitalizing on that momentum!

I have worked with students on 

[molecular gastronomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/molecular-gastronomy),

a meta-analysis of a athletic injuries and [genetic polymorphism in a collagen (*COL1A1*) subunit gene](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=COL1A1),

and a content analysis of terpene composition and user experience reports with *Cannabis spp.* on a popular website.

These projects push both students and myself to think outside of our familiar spaces and into looking at the world as a mystery and a puzzle!
