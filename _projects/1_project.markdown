Organisms are limited in their capacity to acquire and allocate energy and other resources, resulting in tradeoffs between competing biological demands. These tradeoffs constrain evolution and influence phenotypic variation and health. For example, the number of children borne by a woman during her reproductive lifespan affects her disease risks and post-reproductive life expectancy. While consistent with evolutionary theory and research in other species, the mechanistic processes linking these ‘costs of reproduction’ to women’s health are unclear. Furthermore, women’s reproductive choices and obligations are situated within – and shaped by – broader social and physical contexts that affect health through other pathways.

    The three major categories in life history theory are growth, reproduction, and maintenance. Some scholars further partition maintenance between shorter term 'survival' and 'defense', because some physiological and immunological defenses can come at the expense of long-term health and survival.

A major branch of my research is centered on an assessment of the epigenetic processes underlying costs of reproduction in a cohort of young men and women in the Philippines. This work is conducted in collaboration with researchers in the US, Canada, and the Philippines as part of the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS).

The CLHNS is a large, longitudinal, multigenerational study based in metropolitan Cebu City, comprising more than 20 waves of data collected over the past 35 years. In addition to repeated measurements of participant growth, development, health, and reproduction, this study has generated extensive endocrine, immunological, genetic, and epigenetic data.

To test for costs of reproduction among women in Cebu, I used a measure of molecular aging referred to as ‘epigenetic age’. Epigenetic age is a biomarker of biological aging that is based on predictable changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) – a measure related to gene activity – at a subset of loci located across the genome. Epigenetic age unfolds predictably and is believed to reflect the degradation of molecular processes involved in maintaining epigenomic stability. The epigenetic ‘clock’ is the most accurate and robust predictor of chronological age currently available and has been validated in thousands of individuals across dozens of populations. More importantly, accelerated epigenetic age (relative to chronological age) is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality, making it a powerful tool to gauge the long-term health impacts of experiences earlier in the lifecycle [(Ryan 2020)](assets/pdf/Ryan - “Epigenetic clocks” Theory and applications in hu.pdf).


Using epigenetic age (along with telomere length, a second measure of biological aging) as measures of cellular aging and predicted lifespan, we showed that women’s cells ‘aged’ with each additional pregnancy, supporting the theorized tradeoff between reproduction and bodily maintenance at the cellular level [(Ryan et al. 2018)](Ryan et al. - 2018 - Reproduction predicts shorter telomeres and epigen.pdf). This effect was not attributable to genetic variation or to a range of social factors, such as urbanicity, parental education, household assets, or income. Despite evidence for cumulative costs of gravidity on cellular aging, women in our study appeared epigenetically ‘younger’ during pregnancy itself. To explore this paradox, I used genome-wide DNAm to characterize the epigenetic differences between women differing in reproductive status. These differences were used to construct ‘networks’ based on the functional properties of differentially-methylated genes. These findings, which are currently in preparation for publication, point to changes in immune function during pregnancy as potentially contributing to the lower risk for some cancers among parous women compared to nullipara. Furthermore, evidence for altered DNAm related to neurogenesis among parous women could shed light on previously reported effect of grand multiparity (>5 children) on Alzheimer’s Disease risk. Our finding that reproduction may carry not only cumulative costs (see also [Sharazi, Hastings, Rosinger, and Ryan 2020](Shirazi et al. - 2020 - Parity predicts biological age acceleration in pos.pdf)) but also targeted protection, highlights the complex effects that reproduction likely confers on women’s health.
