Stressed? Eating differently? Exercising or not exercising enough? If you're a man, you might wonder if this can have an impact on your sperm and the health of your future offspring weeks, months, or even years in the future? My review of **paternal germline epigenetic inheritance** in human and non-human mammals with [Chris Kuzawa](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mGbhuRcAAAAJ&hl=en) is out now! 

Hit up [the journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/evan.21828) for the article or download [here](assets/pdfs/Ryan and Kuzawa - Germline epigenetic inheritance Challenges and op.pdf). :monkey: It's super cool! :sunglasses:
