:hourglass_flowing_sand: Have you heard about Epigenetic clocks, but don't know where to start? In my new paper, out now in AJHB, I discuss what are they, how are they constructed, and what can they tell us about human health and natural variation in biological aging. 
:older_woman: :older_man:

A one-stop-shop for both the theoretical and practical aspects of using epigenetic clocks in Anthropology, Medical Genetics, and aligned fields! Check it out [at the journal](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajhb.23488) or download [here](assets/pdfs/Ryan - ?Epigenetic clocks? Theory and applications in hu.pdf).
